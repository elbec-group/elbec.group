bio: I am a Lecturer at the Department of Basic, Developmental and Educational
  Psychology of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. I started working as an
  associate professor at the UAB in 2019 until 2022, when I undertook a
  postdoctoral stay at City University of London. In 2024, I returned to the UAB
  as a lecturer. My research combines both theoretical and practical knowledge
  from more than 6 years of experience in schools and clinics as a speech
  therapist with children and adults with linguistic, cognitive and social
  difficulties. My research to date focuses on cognitive, linguistic and
  socio-cognitive aspects of neurodivergent individuals (e.g., hearing loss).
