abstract: This study explores the difficulties on grammatical representation
  descriptions of Spanish Imperfect meanings by 54 first language Russian
  learners of Spanish with advanced proficiency levels and a control group of 18
  Spanish native speakers. The results from the on-line acceptability judgments
  task the participants carried out indicated that interpretations of aspectual
  meanings typical of the Spanish Imperfect had been formed in the non-native
  speaker’s grammar. Moreover, a general tendency to over-accept non-adequate
  Preterite sentences was observed in non-native Spanish speaker groups.
  Furthermore, the findings revealed that progressive meaning represented a
  greater challenge for Russian learners of Spanish with upper-intermediate
  proficiency level, whereas at more advanced levels the perceptions of this
  meaning became closer to that of Spanish native speakers. However, the
  accuracy and sensitivity scores on lexical aspectual classes evidenced a
  persistent difficulty for non-native speakers in non-prototypical
  lexical-grammatical aspect combinations, which suggested a possible remaining
  effect of L1 transfer.
