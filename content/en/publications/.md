abstract: This paper presents a case study of an internal student of Moroccan
  origin at a prison located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona within the
  framework of the European project KA2 StrategicPartnershipRiUscire. The first
  results of the European project suggest the cultural diversity and
  plurilingualism of the prison context and the need to improve the
  intercultural competence and linguistic competence of internal students, in
  order to contribute to their social and professional reintegration. The
  present study aims to investigate in the linguistic repertoire and the
  linguistic uses of the young man. We have also explored how he values his
  linguistic competence in different languages as well as his attitudes towards
  languages that make up his linguistic repertoire. The exploratory research is
  framed within a qualitative methodology and consists in analysing a
  semi-structured interview that the young man gave in the prison considering
  the discourse analysis method taking into account what the interviewee says
  and how.
