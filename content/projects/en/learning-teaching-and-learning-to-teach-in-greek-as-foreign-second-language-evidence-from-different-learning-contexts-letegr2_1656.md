abstract: >-
  The purpose of the **LETEGR2** research project (2018-2022) was to shed light
  on the way Greek is learned and taught in different learning contexts (second
  and foreign language context), as well as to identify good teaching practices
  that could potentially facilitate the teaching of Greek in each of these
  contexts. Nowadays, given the fact that there is a growing need for learning
  Greek as Second Language (SL) /Foreign Language (FL), firstly, examining how
  Greek can be taught in a more efficient way for different target groups of
  learners and, secondly, adequately training and certifying teachers of Greek
  are issues of great importance for our community. In order to address these
  issues, the current project set three interrelated and complementary studies.
  The three studies were meant to approach the area of Modern Greek as a SL/FL
  from different perspectives and also to do so by taking into account all the
  parties implied in the learning process.\

  \

  The **LETEGR2** project was funded by the General Secretariat of Research and Innovation (GSRI) and by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI). The Host Institutions for the LETEGR2 project were the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece and the Modern Greek Language Teaching Center.
