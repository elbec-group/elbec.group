abstract: >-
  The project intends to document the intercultural practices of schools
  enrolling foreign students, aiming to assess the strengths and weaknesses. The
  proposed action will support the positive role played by the educational
  formal and non-formal agencies and communities through field research and
  documentation activities, as well as the mutual sharing and diffusion of
  Intercultural Good Practices.


  The project is articulated in 3 interconnected Workstreams: mapping and investigate the multicultural challenges faced by the school system and its resilience capacity in transit migration areas (WS 1); experimenting a pilot model of intercultural learning in transit migration societies and systematization of the research’s findings framed in a pilot model’s proposal (WS 2); promoting and disseminating the “Sicilian intercultural model” for intercultural dialogue and inclusion at regional and EU level (WS 3).


  Throughout the research, the contribution of the teachers interviews will be crucial, as the outcome of the educational process mainly relies on the capabilities of teachers to transform the school in a space of active citizenship.
