  A didactic resource is proposed to improve the quality of the learning and
  education process of content and competencies related to speech therapy
  practice, complementing face-to-face practice with virtual training. 


  Based on the experience acquired in the organisation of the *I and II Inter-University Online Conference on Speech Therapy Practice*, a related action is proposed, but sustainable in the medium and long term, which consists of the design and creation of a bank of videoconferences oriented towards practical healthcare training. The construction of this bank will be based on the information on areas of interest, self-perception of competences not named and formats considered practical, obtained from the students in these previous actions. 


  We hope that this project will contribute to covering the practical training needs of Speech Therapy students, a health qualification that requires a high level of practical training, providing them with a resource to (a) be able to face a critical mass of cases and practice their analysis according to diagnostic objectives, (b) have access to the explanation and application of techniques and intervention strategies that are little known or difficult to master, and (c) practice clinical reasoning on cases that are difficult to access, without the need for teachers and centers to intervene in a face-to-face manner.
