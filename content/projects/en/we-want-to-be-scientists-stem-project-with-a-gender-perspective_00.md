  The aim of the project "We want to be scientists! STEM project with a gender
  perspective" is to contribute to the scientific education of schoolchildren in
  the fifth and sixth years of primary school and the first cycle of ESO, to
  promote literacy and knowledge transfer, the generation of scientific
  vocations with a gender perspective and to bring schoolchildren closer to the
  university. The proposal carried out during the 2021-2022 academic year
  consisted of a series of activities that led schoolchildren to carry out a
  STEM project, guided by teachers from their schools and university student
  mentors. The teachers and mentors, who received prior training at the
  university, were supported by the training team to resolve doubts and guide
  the process. The students also participated in a workshop on gender and
  science coordinated by female teachers who are experts in this field. The
  resulting projects were presented at the schools and at an Experiences Fair
  that took place at the UAB on 31 May 2022. These actions are expected to
  contribute to the scientific education of schoolchildren, fostering the
  acquisition of knowledge, familiarisation with scientific methodology and
  interest in science. It is also expected to contribute to the empowerment of
  female students for the generation of scientific vocations. 


  The project involved 17 class groups from 7 primary and secondary schools (400 students in the fifth and sixth years of primary school and in the first and second years of ESO); 15 teachers from the participating schools, who received training and support from the UAB training team (team from the Research Centre for Scientific and Mathematical Research-CRECIM), as well as the involvement of the school management team and faculty, 30 university student mentors (mostly women), Finally, teachers from the Faculties of Science, Biosciences and the School of Engineering of the UAB were also involved in the organisation of workshops of a scientific and technological nature aimed at the students of the participating schools.
