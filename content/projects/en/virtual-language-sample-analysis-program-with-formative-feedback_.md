  This proposal aims to create a didactic resource for several subjects of the
  Speech Therapy Degree. Specifically, this resource will allow students to
  autonomously analyse speech and writing samples based on different analytical
  criteria (phonology, lexicon, morphosyntax, spelling, discourse), and to use
  the conceptual knowledge acquired in the theoretical sessions in the analysis
  of real cases. A virtual methodology with an automatic feedback module is
  proposed, which will favour the autonomous work of the students. 


  This project consists of 4 phases including: (a) the collection of speech and writing samples from public databases, (b) the design and development of the analysis guidelines for each teaching purpose and adapted to each subject, (c) the virtualisation of the analysis and feedback guidelines so that they are compatible with the UAB virtual classroom system (moodle), and (d) the pilot test of the implementation of the system. 


  The programme is expected to respond to a repeated demand from students to increase the experience with practical cases. In addition, the competences achieved during this activity will consolidate the learning of not only practical but also theoretical aspects referring to the functioning and development of oral and written language, which can be transferred to other subjects of the Degree.
