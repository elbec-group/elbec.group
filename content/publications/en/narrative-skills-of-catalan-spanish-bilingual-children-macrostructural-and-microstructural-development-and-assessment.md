abstract: This study investigates the development of narrative skills in
  Catalan-Spanish bilingual children, a rarely studied combination of languages
  in a bilingual context where neither language serves as a minority input,
  meaning both are widely used in the community. Seventy children aged 4 to 7
  were assessed in both of their languages using the Multilingual Instrument
  Assessment of Narratives. The effects of language, age, and exposure on
  narrative macrostructure and microstructure were examined. Results indicate
  that both age and language influence these levels, while exposure affects
  specific microstructural measures (grammaticality, discourse markers, and
  code-switching). Certain aspects of narrative performance, such as
  comprehension questions, lexical diversity, MLCU, and subordination, develop
  in only one language, while others, including all other macrostructural
  measures, narrative length, MLCUmax, and code-switching, develop in both.
  Interestingly, children perform better in macrostructural aspects when
  narrating in Spanish, despite being schooled in Catalan and regardless of
  language exposure. However, in microstructural aspects, children show a
  disadvantage in grammatical accuracy in Spanish. These findings highlight the
  importance of considering age, exposure, and language of production when
  assessing language in bilinguals. The study contributes information on
  narrative development in Catalan-Spanish bilingual children, offering insights
  for assessment practices in bilingual populations.
