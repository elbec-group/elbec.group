abstract: "This paper introduces Developing analytical writing (DAW), a model of
  text analysis aimed at capturing how social expectancies of analytical writing
  become part of students’ linguistic literacy. DAW proposes a multilayer
  analysis of text features on repeated text production prompted by the same and
  different topics, control for pedagogical input, and researcher- and
  reader-based evaluations of text quality. We revise DAW previous
  implementations that delved into lexical, syntactic-discursive, and structural
  aspects of analytical essays as indexes for developing writing proficiency. We
  focus thereafter on a current application of DAW to assess content-related
  dimensions: explicitness of a central standpoint, flexibility of writers’
  positioning, and expression of reflective thinking. Analyses revealed that the
  probability of explicitness and reflexiveness increases from elementary to
  higher levels of schooling, while the probability of flexible positioning
  appeared conditioned by text topic and pedagogical input. The three dimensions
  showed stronger effect of instruction on high schoolers’ than on elementary
  and university students’ texts. Regression analyses support a foundational
  role of development and a significant contribution of the assessed dimensions
  to an appraisal of text quality. DAW facilitates distinguishing analytical
  text features that improve in the course of development from those sensitive
  to pedagogical scaffolding."
