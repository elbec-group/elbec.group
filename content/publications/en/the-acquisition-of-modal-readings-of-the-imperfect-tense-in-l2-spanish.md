abstract: The Imperfect/Preterite aspectual contrast is one of the most studied
  topics in Spanish as a second language research. However, there are few works
  focused on describing the acquisition of modal uses of the Imperfect by L2
  speakers. This paper investigates the L1 Russian L2 Spanish speakers’ mastery
  of politeness, evidential and nonfactual modal values of the Imperfect. Based
  on a Timed Acceptability Judgments Task (TAJT), this study examines the degree
  of acceptability of Imperfect forms in modal contexts in three groups of
  advanced level L2 Spanish learners. The results show that only the Imperfect
  of politeness achieves acceptance rates similar to those of native speakers at
  the most advanced levels of proficiency. The high degree of lexicalization of
  some imperfect forms, which function as pragmatic routines in certain
  communicative situations, is alleged to facilitate this tendency. In contrast,
  the evidential and nonfactual Imperfect forms present greater challenges for
  the L2 Spanish speakers. The results of our study indicate that (i) the
  imperfect forms are not recognized as legitimate alternatives for marking
  evidentiality and nonfactuality and (ii) reflect a partial form-function
  mapping of learners’ knowledge of the Imperfect and its associated values.
