abstract: "The linguistic profile of multilingual individuals can vary
  significantly due to diversity in linguistic experience. This poses challenges
  for language researchers, educators, and clinical practitioners. We developed
  a Multilingual Use Assessment Questionnaire (MUAQ) to capture the
  heterogeneous nature of multilinguals profiles integrating three dimensions:
  self-assessment of language(s) competence, language(s) use for mental
  operations, and language(s) use in different contexts. The questionnaire was
  administered to bilingual Catalan/Spanish children and adults across three
  educational levels: elementary school (year 6), secondary school (year 10),
  and university level. The applicationof the MUAQ revealed that Catalan/Spanish
  bilinguals displayed variations in their self-assessed proficiency based on
  the type of linguistic activity required by each language. While high
  bilingual competence was concentrated in oral comprehension, production skills
  exhibited lower bilingual competence and a strong asymmetry between languages
  emerged in writing. Also, more pronounced preferences for one language were
  observed for Thinking and Counting. Whereas Catalan (the language of
  schooling) was more frequently preferred for Counting, a more multilingual
  approach was observed for Thinking. A significant heterogeneity was also
  evident in the language(s) used in different contexts, with each third of the
  study population demonstrating distinct patterns of linguistic behavior
  depending on the context. An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) identified two
  key dimensions (linguistic competence skills and languages involved in mental
  operations) that accounted for a substantial portion of the variance, while
  the third dimension (language use in different contexts) bifurcated into
  situational/communicative vs. personal contexts. These results endorse
  multidimensional approaches for a comprehensive understanding of
  multilingualism."
