abstract: The aim of this study is to examine the affordances of images to
  prompt reflective processes of preservice teachers writing in a digital
  environment. The study was conducted over three academic years and a total of
  180 preservice teachers were asked to write a blog post to reflect on how they
  learn to write and their approach on teaching children how to write. This
  study analyses the type of images used in the blog posts and the
  logico-semantic relationships between the images and the written text. The
  core data were gathered from the preservice teachers’ blog posts, and then
  triangulated with the individual written reflections and with the group
  recordings analysing their respective posts. The results indicate that the
  blog posts in which preservice teachers use images either connected to
  personal experiences or with a metaphorical effect, the image-text relation
  enhances their reflections; whereas the most neutral images that illustrate
  the act of writing give no added value to their reflections. The discussion
  addresses the issues on how to help preservice teachers to use images in
  digital writing in a meaningful way that can deepen their reflective
  processes.
