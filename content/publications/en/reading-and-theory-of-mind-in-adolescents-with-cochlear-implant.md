abstract: Previous research has shown a possible link between reading
  comprehension and theory of mind (ToM), but these findings are unclear in
  adolescents with cochlear implants (CI). In the present study, reading
  comprehension and ToM were assessed in adolescents with CI and the relation
  between both skills was also studied. Two sessions were performed on two
  groups of adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years of age (36 adolescents with
  CI and 54 participants with typical hearing, TH). They were evaluated by means
  of a standardized reading battery, a false belief task, and Faux Pas stories.
  The results indicated that reading and cognitive ToM were more developed in
  the TH group than in adolescents with CI. However, early-CI and binaural group
  performance were close to the TH group in narrative and expository
  comprehension and cognitive ToM. The results also indicated that cognitive ToM
  and reading comprehension appear to be related in deaf adolescents.
