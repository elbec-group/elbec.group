abstract: "This study examines the results of an intervention conducted with
  adult EFL learners in Barcelona, Spain, to foster engagement with the target
  language outside class time. As part of the programme, the messaging service
  WhatsApp was used to carry out a range of voluntary communicative tasks, in
  learners’ own time. Familiarity with this tool made it easy to use, and
  learner feedback was positive. Analysis of the resulting chat transcript
  indicated that (1) off-task participation increased as learners appropriated
  the space as a vehicle for their own communication, (2) off-task interactions
  fell predominantly into two categories: administrative and social, and (3)
  despite being voluntary and unevaluated, with minimum teacher intervention,
  English was overwhelmingly the language of choice within these interactions.
  We hope this study can serve as an example of the possibilities offered by the
  WhatsApp medium in an EFL context."
