abstract: "The importance of cultivating creativity in language education has
  been widely acknowledged in the academic literature. In this respect, digital
  technologies can play a key role in achieving this endeavour. The
  socio-cultural conceptualization of creativity stresses the role of
  communication, collaboration and dialogical interaction of creative expression
  in language education. The objective of this paper is to study the literature
  focusing on cases of collaborative creativity and technology embedded in
  language education. To this end, we carry out a systematic revision of
  state-of-the-art literature consisting of 26 blind peer-reviewed empirical
  studies selected from several databases that address our main research
  question, namely, which specific roles and forms of digital technology can be
  identified in the existing literature that support collaborative creativity in
  language education. Results show that the features of digital technology
  unfold a range of learning opportunities in language education and can play
  three different roles in promoting collaborative creativity: (1) as a tutoring
  device that guides the implementation of key co-creation skills; (2) as a tool
  that enables and shapes the development of co-creative thinking skills; and
  (3) as a medium that creates rich and resourceful environments to stimulate
  the emergence of collective creative processes. The paper also reveals that
  these three roles can be performed using a wide range of interactive
  technologies that encourage students to participate in a rich, co-creative
  language learning experience and equip learners with key competences to
  approach complex problems in a globalised and hyper-connected world. Finally,
  this paper may contribute to developing future language technology-enhanced
  learning projects capable of promoting key collaborative and creative
  processes."
