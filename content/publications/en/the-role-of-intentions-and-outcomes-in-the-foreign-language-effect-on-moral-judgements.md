abstract: We explore the origin of the foreign language effect on moral
  judgements by assessing whether language context alters the weight given to
  intentions and outcomes during moral judgement. Specifically, we investigated
  whether foreign language contexts, compared with native ones, may lead people
  to focus more on the outcomes of an action and less on the intentions behind
  it. We report two studies in which participants read scenarios in which the
  actor’s intentions and the resulting consequences were manipulated. As
  previously shown, people considered both the actor’s intentions and the
  action’s outcomes when assessing the damage, cause, moral wrongness,
  responsibility, and punishment deserved. However, although the foreign
  language context reduced the impact of intentions on damage assessment, the
  overall effect of intention and outcomes on these variables was mainly the
  same in the foreign and the native language contexts. We conclude that
  differential weighting of intentions and outcomes is unlikely to account for
  the impact of foreign language use on moral judgement.
