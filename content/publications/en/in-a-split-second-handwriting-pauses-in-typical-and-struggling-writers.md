  Introduction: A two-second threshold has been typically used when analyzing
  the writing processes. However, there is only a weak empirical basis to claim
  that specific average numbers and durations of pauses may be associated with
  specific writing processes. We focused on handwriting execution pauses,
  because immature writers are known to struggle with transcription skills. We
  aimed to provide an evidence-based account of the average number and duration
  of handwriting pauses in the mid-Primary grades and to identify process-level
  markers of writing difficulties.



  Methods: Eighty 3rd and 5th graders, with and without writing difficulties, participated in the study. We examined pauses in a handwriting-only task, to be able to isolate those which could only be attributed to handwriting processes. Letter features were considered, as well as children’s handwriting fluency level.



  Results: The average duration of handwriting pauses was around 400ms, in line with assumptions that transcription pauses would fall under the 2,000ms threshold. We found that 3rd graders made more and longer pauses than 5th graders. Struggling writers made a similar number of pauses across grades than typically-developing children, although they were significantly longer, even after controlling for the effect of handwriting fluency.



  Discussion: Our findings provide an evidence-based account of the duration of handwriting pauses. They also suggest that children need fewer and shorter handwriting pauses as they progress in automatizing transcription. However, some young writers struggle with letter formation even after 3 to 5 years of instruction
