abstract: "The Spanish correlative pair por un lado (Eng. ‘on the one hand’) and
  por otro lado (Eng. ‘on the other hand’) fulfill an informative structuring
  function: it presents two subcomments and organizes them under the same topic.
  Its procedural meaning does not provide a clear instruction on the
  argumentative orientation of the cohesive segments. Thus, they can be used
  both in argumentatively co-oriented and anti-oriented contexts, depending on
  the argumentative orientation raised by the conceptual words that make up the
  segments in the discourse. However, two self-paced reading experiments
  (grammatical judgement and production) that were carried out with 95 and 60
  native speakers of Spanish, respectively, show that the degree of
  acceptability differs according to whether this correlative pair of markers is
  used in contexts of argumentative co-orientation or anti-orientation. Results
  suggest that the use of this pair in argumentatively co-oriented segment may
  result in overmarking if the volume of information is not relevant."
