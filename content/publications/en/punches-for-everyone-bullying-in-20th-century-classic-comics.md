abstract: The word bullying is an Anglicism whose meaning is, in general terms,
  that of harassment suffered by one person from another or others in a given
  relationship context, especially at school. It comes from the English verb to
  bully, that is, to use force or influence to intimidate someone, especially to
  force them to do something. We can talk about different types of bullying
  (physical, verbal, sexual, social, cyberbullying). Our goal is to identify
  types of bullying in a set of comic book characters published in Spain in the
  second half of the 20th century. We aim not only to carry out a descriptive
  analysis of these types of harassment, but also to show models of action to be
  avoided by young readers. After carrying out the analysis, we have seen that,
  although bullying is a relatively new concept, it refers to a set of
  aggressions (slaps, insults, humiliation of all kinds) that unfortunately have
  always occurred in schools, though nowadays they are seen as aggressions
  against which our society fights. Besides that, comic is a text type that has
  received full-blown slaps, since its reading and educational use in schools we
  can firmly state that has not been appropriate. Tales and narrations are
  preferred, to give just a few examples, over comics. That is why we demand
  their use in schools. In a society as visual as ours, full of images and
  audiovisual codes of all kinds, comics have a visual component that will
  undoubtedly help the narrative development of school readers.
