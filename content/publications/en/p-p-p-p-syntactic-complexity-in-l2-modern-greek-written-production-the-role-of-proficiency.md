  The present study examines the development of syntactic complexity across

  different language proficiency levels. The research involved 55 L2 Greek learners who

  participated in an intensive six-week summer program in Greece. Their proficiency levels

  ranged from A2 to C2. The participants completed a written task in which they wrote

  an opinion essay. Various indices based on sentences, clauses, and T-units were used to

  measure and analyze their written production. According to the results, the L2 proficiency

  only affected the indices of subordinate complexity. Specifically, indicators related to

  subordination, such as subordinate clauses per T-unit, subordinate clauses per clause,

  and clauses per T-unit, were found to be influenced by proficiency level. Advanced-level

  students (C1-C2) exhibited a higher degree of subordination compared to intermediatelevel (B1-B2) and beginner-level (A2) learners. On the other hand, other syntactic

  complexity indicators, including mean length, coordination, and sentence complexity,

  were not influenced by language proficiency level. Based on these findings, we argue that

  the three indicators of subordination are suitable for distinguishing and characterizing the language proficiency levels of learners. However, none of the syntactic complexity indices

  examined in this study were found suitable for distinguishing adjacent levels. Therefore,

  future research should focus on additional indices, such as those related to the complexity

  of phrasal structure (nominal and verbal phrases). At the pedagogical level, we consider

  that L2 Greek teachers have a useful tool for assessing the linguistic performance of their

  students in relation to their language proficiency level. Furthermore, the corpus created

  within the scope of this research provides examples that can be utilized for instructional

  purposes, particularly for teaching different types of sentence conjunction, to enhance

  the written syntactic complexity of L2 Greek learners.
