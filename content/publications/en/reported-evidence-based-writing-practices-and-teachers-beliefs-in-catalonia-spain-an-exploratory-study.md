abstract: This paper investigates the reported frequency of the use of
  evidence-based writing practices (EBWPs) by teachers (N = 51) in primary and
  secondary school classrooms in a sample of schools in the Barcelona
  metropolitan area (Spain), and how teacher beliefs contribute to the reported
  use of EBWPs. The results showed that the teachers declared to implement most
  of the EBWPs from previous studies. The three most frequent declared practices
  were 1) give praise individually for writing, 2) teaching writing strategies
  for planning and writing skills, and 3) using text assessment as a guide to
  shape instructions. Regarding teachers’ beliefs about teaching writing, the
  study focused on teachers’ attitudes and teacher efficacy. The results on
  attitude showed that teachers had a positive attitude toward writing. Results
  regarding teacher efficacy showed that teachers felt quite efficacious,
  especially when they were required to determine the level of difficulty in
  written assignments. A factor analysis of the EBWPs showed that the two main
  factors for the frequency of reported use of EBWPS were strategy teaching for
  evidence-based writing and writing practices based on text assessment. PLS
  regression analyses showed that the reported frequency of use of EBWPs was
  highly predicted by the feeling of efficacy of teachers.
