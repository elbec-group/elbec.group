abstract: "The identification of bilingual children with Developmental Language
  Disorder (DLD) is complex, and the assessment of narratives may be
  particularly valuable in this context. Therefore, the aim of this study is to
  contribute to systematize and disseminate the growing body of literature
  investigating the narrative skills of bilingual children with DLD through a
  systematic review guided by the following questions: What aspects at the level
  of narrative macrostructure and microstructure have been studied in bilingual
  children with DLD? What features of narrative macrostructure and
  microstructure differentiate bilingual children with DLD from typically
  developing bilinguals? What features of narrative macrostructure and
  microstructure differentiate bilinguals with DLD from monolinguals with DLD?
  25 articles were selected from WoS and Scopus databases. Overall, results
  point to a lower performance both in the bilingual and monolingual DLD
  population on several measures at both levels, although the core problem is
  considered to be microstructure. However, there are some contradictory
  results, so that further research on specific narrative features in both
  children’s languages is encouraged in order to find clinical markers
  contributing to a greater efficiency in the assessment of bilingual children.
  Furthermore, it is suggested that narrative assessment could be combined with
  other measures to increase the diagnostic accuracy of DLD."
