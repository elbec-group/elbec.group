abstract: Despite increasing interest over the last decade in the acquisition of
  Modern Greek by Spanish learners, there is thus far little to no research on
  the topic. This chapter aims to partly fill this gap by sketching out the
  profile of students taking courses in Modern Greek in Barcelona, Spain, as
  well as their motivation for doing so. To this end, empirical data on student
  motivation were collected by means of a questionnaire from 156 adult
  participants, all of whom were studying Modern Greek as a foreign language at
  one of two institutions in Barcelona, the publicly-funded Official School of
  Languages and the School of Modern Greek, a private institution run by the
  Greek community of Barcelona. Findings showed that the average age of students
  was somewhat higher than that seen for learners of more frequently studied
  foreign languages worldwide like English or French, and their motives for
  studying Modern Greek were largely linked to personal satisfaction or cultural
  interests, rather than to practical reasons. The implications of this research
  for the teaching of Modern Greek in this kind of educational context as well
  as teacher education are discussed briefly.
