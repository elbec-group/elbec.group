abstract: The beliefs of pre-service teachers in initial teacher education (ITE)
  in Catalonia about plurilingualism and teaching in diverse classrooms are
  analysed and tensions in their discourse are observed. Following the analysis
  of discourse in interaction (e.g. Heller \[2005]. Discourse and interaction.
  In D. Schiffrin, D. Tannen, & H. E. Hamilton (Eds.), The handbook of discourse
  analysis (pp. 250â€“264). Blackwell Publishers Ltd), we analyse data from an
  individual reflection task and subsequent focus group discussion in which
  pre-service teachers discuss their ideas about linguistically sensitive
  teaching. Our findings suggest that pre-service teachers have very positive
  ideas regarding being plurilingual speakers. However, when positioning
  themselves as teachers, the feelings they express about linguistic diversity
  in schools become negative. These ideas are linked to ideological
  constructions that circulate, for example, in European institutional
  discourses about multi/plurilingualism and in neoliberal conceptions of
  languages and learning. We suggest that more spaces for discussion and
  reflection are needed in ITE in order to promote linguistically sensitive
  teaching among future practitioners.
