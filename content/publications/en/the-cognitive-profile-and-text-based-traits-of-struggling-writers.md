abstract: Writing difficulties have typically been investigated as the
  consequence of learning disabilities. However, several characteristics of
  texts and the underlying cognitive skills are often shared across these
  populations. Our aim was to investigate the writing and cognitive profile of
  children at risk of writing difficulties, regardless of whether they have
  concomitant diagnoses. Drawing from a sample of 357 primary school children,
  we identified children who showed low levels on a single writing component,
  such as handwriting (15), spelling (39) or text generation (17), and 11
  children who showed difficulties across two or more components. We compared
  them to a typically developing group (50) on a series of writing features
  (e.g., spelling, vocabulary) and cognitive and linguistic skills (e.g.,
  working memory, morphosyntax). Children who struggled with a single writing
  component showed difficulties also in other components. Children with multiple
  writing difficulties struggled with most writing features. All children
  displayed similar levels in key cognitive and linguistic skills. Our data thus
  present compelling evidence of children who struggle with writing, despite no
  obvious cognitive or linguistic impairments.
