abstract: This study evaluates the perceptions of Japanese speakers of Spanish
  L2/FL regarding the ‘tú’/‘usted’ alternation in the formulation of requests.
  This choice regulates formality in Spanish, whereas in Japanese, it is
  regulated by verb inflection and certain lexical variations that are used more
  frequently than ‘usted’ in Peninsular Spanish. It is proposed that Japanese
  learners may experience difficulties in acquiring Spanish politeness due to
  this interlinguistic contrast. To examine this phenomenon, a discourse
  selection task (MDCT) in Spanish was administered to two groups of learners
  (L1 = Japanese; L1 = other languages) and a group of native Spanish speakers.
  The results suggest that Japanese speakers perceive ‘tú’ as a less appropriate
  form of address in favor of ‘usted’. However, these speakers can reach
  native-like competence as their proficiency level increases.
