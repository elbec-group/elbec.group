abstract: "This monographic volume of the CLIL Journal of Innovation and
  Research in Plurilingual and Pluricultural Education focuses on Teaching
  Catalan as an Additional Language to Adults and all the articles have a double
  objective: to create points of connection between teachers, trainers and
  researchers in language acquisition and didactics and to do so by providing
  evidence on language acquisition and didactic experiences in the field of
  teaching Catalan as an additional language to adults. The monograph contains
  six articles, in which the authors address the complexity and richness of
  teaching Catalan to adults from different perspectives."
