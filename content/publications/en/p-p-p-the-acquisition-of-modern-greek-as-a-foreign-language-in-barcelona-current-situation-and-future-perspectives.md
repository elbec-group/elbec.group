abstract: This study examines the learning and teaching of Modern Greek as a
  Foreign Language in Barcelona, where interest has grown in recent years
  despite limited linguistic research in this context. It focuses on the formal
  instruction of adult learners, exploring their profiles and motivations. Based
  on data from 156 students collected between 2018 and 2021 through detailed
  questionnaires, the study analyzes sociolinguistic backgrounds, language
  exposure, experiences in Greece, and motivations for learning Greek. Through
  qualitative analysis, it investigates linguistic ideologies, learner needs,
  and attitudes toward the language. Finally, the study discusses practical
  implications for improving Modern Greek instruction in Spain.
