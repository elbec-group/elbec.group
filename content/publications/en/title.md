abstract: "This paper investigated the role that types of knowledge beyond
  phonology have on spelling development, such as knowledge of
  morpheme-to-grapheme mappings, of orthographic patterns, and of word-specific
  orthographic patterns. It is based on the modern view that children do not
  learn spelling in discrete stages but, rather, they apply different types of
  strategies from early on. The goals of the paper were threefold: (1) to
  determine the relative difficulty of different types of non-phonological
  spelling strategies, (2) to examine the contribution of non-phonological
  strategies (specifically, morphological, morphophonological, orthographic, and
  lexical) to conventional spelling scores, and (3) to determine the role of
  children’s educational level and population type (first- vs. second-language
  learners) on spelling strategy use. A large sample of 982 children (497 boys),
  speakers of Catalan (a Romance language similar to Spanish but with a less
  consistent orthography), participated in the study. They were administered a
  bespoke dictation task aimed to test their conventional and phonographic
  accuracy skill, as well as to determine their ability to use different types
  of non-phonological strategies for the spelling of ambiguous phonemes. Data
  were analyzed with a series of multigroup, multilevel SEMs. Results showed
  that (1) children across groups found morphological and lexical strategies
  harder to apply than orthographic and morphophonological strategies and (2)
  all types of non-phonological strategies contributed greatly to spelling
  accuracy scores, even after controlling for children’s phonographic skills.
  Efficient strategy use increased as a function of schooling level, while
  second-language learners had a worse performance throughout, but no group
  showed a specific pattern of results. In conclusion, the paper offers
  substantial evidence that non-phonological strategies are paramount to
  learning to spell at least during the early and intermediate elementary school
  years. It is suggested that the teaching of writing should therefore be
  multidimensional in nature and target particularly the strategies with which
  children struggle the most: knowledge of morpho-graphemic mappings and
  word-specific lexical representations. Theoretical implications are also
  discussed."
