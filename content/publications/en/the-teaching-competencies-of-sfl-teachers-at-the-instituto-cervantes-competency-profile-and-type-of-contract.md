abstract: The competencies of teachers, their professional development, and
  reflective practice are key issues for foreign language instructors. To
  address these aspects, reference documents have been developed that propose a
  categorization of teaching competencies and provide evaluation grids. The aim
  of this study is to determine the relationships between teaching competencies
  based on the type of contract and their effect on teachers' professional
  development. A questionnaire on competencies of Spanish as a foreign language
  teachers was designed based on the document *The Key Competencies of Teachers*
  from the Instituto Cervantes. Factorial analysis applied to the responses of a
  group of teachers (N = 67) at the Instituto Cervantes identified several
  subcompetencies within the original competencies. The results allowed for the
  characterization of the teachers' competency development and the exploration
  of relationships established between different competencies. Comparisons
  showed differences between permanent teachers and collaborators regarding
  their involvement in professional development and participation in teaching
  improvement activities at the institution. While permanent teachers report
  high active participation at the center, among collaborators, this
  participation is more variable and affects the development of other
  competencies.
