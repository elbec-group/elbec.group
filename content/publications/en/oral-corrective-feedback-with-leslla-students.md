abstract: The role of corrective feedback has aroused much interest in English
  as a second or foreign language research. However, Catalan as an additional
  language is an emerging field of research. This paper focuses on the oral
  corrective feedback that the teacher provides to the studentsâ€™ errors in a
  context of Catalan as an additional language with LESLLA students of an
  educational center located in a penitentiary center. Five 45-to-50-minute
  lessons of classroom interactions were recorded, transcribed and coded for the
  analysis. The findings show that there is a high amount of lexical and
  pronunciation errors. Furthermore, related with oral corrective feedback, the
  most common strategy is recast. Differences between reformulations and prompts
  were noted in terms of frequency. Prompts are less common, even though
  clarification requests and elicitation stand out. Finally, in most cases,
  students notice the oral corrective feedback provided. With recast the amount
  of uptake is very high, although only a third of the cases conduct to repair.
  Prompts lead students to a correction of the error by the students more
  frequently.
