abstract: Analytical writing serves to learn and communicate learning. Our goal
  was to determine the impact of students’ bilingual profile, defined by
  self-evaluated bilingual competence, use of language(s) for mental operations
  and language(s) use across different contexts, on their developing analytical
  writing abilities. Catalan/Spanish bilinguals – in 6th and 10th grade and
  university students – produced three texts on the same topic along a set of
  classroom activities, and a fourth one, on a different topic, one month later.
  We traced changes in text length and structure as indicators of proficiency
  across school levels and texts and tested the contribution of participants’
  linguistic profile on the observed changes. A Structural Equation Modeling on
  indicators of proficiency as growth parameters yielded a positive effect of
  self-evaluated bilingual proficiency on text length of the initial
  productions, whereas use of language for mental operations affected the rate
  of length increment across texts. Participants’ self-evaluations of their
  linguistic proficiency did not affect text structure. The multidimensionality
  of bilingualism contributes differentially to proficiency in analytical
  writing.
