abstract: "In this paper, a classification proposal of causal constructions and
  causal connectivity between clauses and larger discursive segments is
  presented. Such classification is susceptible to be used in subsequent
  corpus-based studies. To do so, we unify two perspectives and classifications
  in the analysis: a) the distinction, in the Hispanic tradition, between
  causales del enunciado y causales de la enunciación and b) the distinction,
  within the relational coherence framework, between semantic and pragmatic
  causal relations (van Dijk, 1979; Sanders, 1997) and, in particular, between
  content, speech act and epistemic causal relations (Sweetser, 1990). After
  addressing its formal characterization, we consider two types of
  constructions, those with verbs of speaking and verbs of thinking in the
  non-causal segment, and ambiguous cases that are pragmatically classifiable as
  speech act causal and epistemic causal relations. We attend, on the one hand,
  to causal connectives, and conceive them as propositional markers (Cuenca,
  Marín, Romano & Porto, 2011); on the other hand, we deal with multi-member
  systems related causal structures. Finally, we highlight the need to identify
  non-canonical uses of causal structures, as well as to continue exploring the
  expression of causality beyond two-member constructions."
