abstract: "Oral and written language are constantly interrelated in literate
  communities. In this paper, we examined the repercussions of teaching
  argumentative oral discourse on the development of argumentative writing and
  vice versa. The participants were seventh-grade students, who were randomly
  assigned to one of three groups: the Oral-1 group, which received an oral
  language intervention first, followed by a written language intervention; the
  Esc-1 group, which received the written language intervention first, followed
  by the oral intervention, and the control group, who attended regular Spanish
  Language and Literature classes. We assessed measures of both oral and written
  argumentative discourse at pretest, posttest-1, and posttest-2 to determine
  the development of both intramodality and intermodality skills. The results
  showed that intramodality effects were larger for the written than for the
  oral language intervention. Both interventions produced intermodality effects.
  We concluded that the teaching of argumentative discourse should incorporate
  the bidirectional influences between the oral and written modalities."
