abstract: In  recent  years,  corrective  feedback  has  aroused  much  interest  and  a  considerable  number  of  studies  have  been  carried  out  in  this  field,  especially  in  English  as  a  second  or  foreign  language,  but  in  Catalan  as  an  additional  language  it  is  still  in  its  early  stages.  This  article  focuses  on
  the oral corrective feedback that the teacher provides to the students
  when  they  produce  an  utterance  that  contains  an  error  in  a  context  of  Catalan  as  an  additional  language  with  low-educated  adult  students  of  an  educational  center  located  in  a  penitentiary  context.  Data  were  collected
  during 5 lessons that were recorded, transcribed and coded for the analysis.
  The results of the study show that there is a high number of mistakes of
  pronunciation and lexicon, apart from frequent use of Spanish (language shared
  with the teacher) when the students are expected to use
  Catalan.  Furthermore,  related  with  oral  corrective  feedback,  the  findings  show  that  the  most  common  strategies  are  recasts  and  translations.  Prompts
  are less common, but clarification requests and elicitation stand
  out.  Finally,  in  most  cases,  students  notice  the  oral  corrective  feedback  provided.
  With recasts and translations the number of uptake is very high, but only a
  third of the cases conduct to repair. Prompts lead students to a correction of
  the error by the students more frequently.
