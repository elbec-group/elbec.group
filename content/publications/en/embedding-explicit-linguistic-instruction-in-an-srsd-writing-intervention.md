abstract: "Teaching linguistic aspects relevant to text construction is an
  essential component of any thorough writing instruction program, despite the
  conflicting evidence regarding its effectiveness. In this study, 889 second-
  and fourth-grade students were assigned to one of three conditions:
  Self-Regulated Development (SRSD), SRSD-connectors (SRSD-C), and
  business-as-usual (BAU). The experimental conditions addressed planning and
  self-regulation strategies to write opinion essays, but only the SRSD
  condition included explicit teaching of connectors (e.g., because) and
  discourse markers (e.g., In conclusion). Children in both experimental
  conditions outscored children in the BAU condition across grades and outcome
  variables. In addition, the SRSD condition showed larger effect sizes on Grade
  2 children’s gains in text quality, number of genre-appropriate elements, and
  number of connectors than the SRSD-C condition. The study provides evidence of
  the effectiveness of explicitly teaching functionally motivated linguistic
  representations within a SRSD program. Theoretical and educational
  implications are discussed."
