abstract: The transition to secondary education is a sensitive period for social
  and academic development and also for student identity. However, there is
  scarce evidence of the development of reading comprehension and theory of mind
  in pupils with cochlear implant (CI) during the educational trajectory. The
  results show that pupils with CI obtain age-appropriate reading scores during
  the educational transition. Theory of mind development seems to be
  heterogeneous in CI users and be affected after the educational transition
  compared to their own performance in the first wave. This variability could be
  related to adaptation to secondary education and their individual
  characteristics.
