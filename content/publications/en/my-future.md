abstract: The study of motivation as an individual variable in language learning
  has produced an extensive body of contributions in the recent decades in
  relation to the success in language learners’ performance and to teaching and
  learning processes. However, the majority of studies have focused on the
  acquisition and teaching of English in different contexts. In the framework of
  the LETEGR2 project, the present exploratory and qualitative study seeks to
  analyze the meanings that learners of Modern Greek as a second language
  (n=102) associate with Greek and how the relationships of these meanings
  interact with motivations towards learning this language. The processing and
  categorization of the participants’ responses by inter‑judge validation and
  their thematic analysis highlight four main aspects associated with language
  as (a) instrument, (b) attitude, (c) personal bond and (d) culture. The
  preliminary results reveal, firstly, positive and very positive attitudes
  towards the Greek language; secondly, the relationship between learning Greek
  and other extralinguistic aspects, such as intergenerational links and the
  role of the historical and cultural legacy of this language.
