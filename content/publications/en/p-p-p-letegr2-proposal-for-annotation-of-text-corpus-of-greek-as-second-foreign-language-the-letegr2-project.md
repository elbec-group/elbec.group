abstract: This paper introduces a new written corpus for L2 Greek as part of the
  LETEGR2 research program, including 1022 productions from 332 students in
  second or foreign language contexts. The data, capturing longitudinal
  information from both learning contexts, is analyzed using an annotation
  protocol based on complexity, accuracy, and fluency. Complexity is assessed by
  annotating main and subordinate clauses, coordination and subordination, and
  the mean length of clausal structure. Accuracy is measured by the number of
  errors, while fluency is measured by the total number of words in the written
  text. Finally, pedagogical implications and research extensions for automated
  processing and analysis of L2 written productions are proposed.
