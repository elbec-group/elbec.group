abstract: The aim of the current research is to describe and analyze the
  specific characteristics of the use of the Spanish verbal past tenses,
  specifically the imperfecto and indefinido, by Russian advanced learners of
  Spanish L2 with high proficiency level in a formal learning environment. The
  collected data come from a semi-spontaneous written production task based on
  an audiovisual stimulus. The results are analyzed and categorized on the basis
  of the narrative structure and the lexical aspect of the verb, with the aim of
  identifying the effect of these factors on the use of past tenses verbs. The
  results reveal an unambiguous preference for the prototypical combinations
  between grammatical, lexical and discursive aspects across all groups.
  Moreover, the highly proficient L2 Spanish learners show a native-like
  performance with respect to the use of the Spanish imperfecto and indefinido
  in the narrative writing task.
