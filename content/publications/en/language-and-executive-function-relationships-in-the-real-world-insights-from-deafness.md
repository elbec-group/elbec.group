abstract: "Executive functions (EFs) in both regulatory and meta-cognitive
  contexts are important for a wide variety of children’s daily activities,
  including play and learning. Despite the growing literature supporting the
  relationship between EF and language, few studies have focused on these links
  during everyday behaviours. Data were collected on 208 children from 6 to 12
  years old of whom 89 were deaf children (55% female; M = 8;8; SD = 1;9) and
  119 were typically hearing children (56% female, M = 8;9; SD = 1;5). Parents
  completed two inventories: to assess EFs and language proficiency. Parents of
  deaf children reported greater difficulties with EFs in daily activities than
  those of hearing children. Correlation analysis between EFs and language
  showed significant levels only in the deaf group, especially in relation to
  meta-cognitive EFs. The results are discussed in terms of the role of early
  parent–child interaction and the relevance of EFs for everyday conversational
  situations."
