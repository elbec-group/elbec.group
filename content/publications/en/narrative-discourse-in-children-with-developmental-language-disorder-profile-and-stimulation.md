abstract: The development of narrative discourse is a good indicator of
  children’s linguistic competence and shows a strong correlation with
  linguistic and academic performance. Children with Developmental Language
  Disorder (DLD) show multiple difficulties in various aspects of narrative
  production and comprehension, which affect theircommunicative skills and may
  affect their learning in school. The implementation of interventional programs
  focused on enhancing narrative skills results in significant changes in
  students with narrative difficulties, in such a way that implementing
  theseprograms would be useful not only for developing linguistic proficiency
  but also for boosting academic performance.
