abstract: The ability to spell words correctly is a cornerstone of literacy.
  Despite the substantial amount of research into this process, a large part of
  the empirical findings come from English-speaking populations. Given the
  distinctive features of the varying orthographic systems worldwide, more
  research into spelling across orthographies seems warranted. To stimulate this
  was the main goal of this Research Topic, which contains two review plus 14
  research articles tapping 11 orthographies (viz., Arabic, Catalan, Chinese,
  English, French, Hebrew, Malay, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil, and Welsh), from
  first graders to undergraduates. These articles were organized into three
  sections focusing on (1) the type of misspellings produced, (2) the role of
  non-phonological knowledge in spelling, and (3) the view of spelling as a
  basic writing process. Together, the findings from the studies included in the
  Research Topic showed that the type of misspellings produced is influenced by
  writing systems, writers' characteristics, and spelling tasks; that
  morphological, orthographic, morpho-orthographic, and syntactical knowledge
  are important sources of information to produce accurate spellings in varying
  orthographic systems; and that spelling is a fundamental writing process
  intertwined with handwriting. In sum, this Research Topic provides an
  up-to-date view on spelling across orthographies, which will contribute to
  increase our understanding of this process and instigate further research into
  it.
