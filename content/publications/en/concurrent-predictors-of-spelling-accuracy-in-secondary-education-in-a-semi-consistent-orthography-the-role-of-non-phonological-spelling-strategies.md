abstract: "Spelling is a complex skill that requires mobilizing various levels
  of linguistic and orthographic representation. While there is substantial
  evidence of the impact of phonological skills in its development, less is
  known about the explanatory value of non-phonological (e.g., morphological,
  orthographic) strategies in conventional spelling scores. This study assessed
  the unique impact of non-phonological spelling strategies after accounting for
  a large set of linguistic and cognitive predictors, as well as contextual
  variables (e.g., SES) in a language with a semi-consistent orthography:
  Catalan. Participants were 328 eighth-grade students from low-income
  households. Results showed that non-phonological spelling skills explained a
  substantial proportion of the variance in conventional spelling, over and
  above the rest of predictor variables, including phonographic skills, with the
  final model explaining more than 80% of the variance. Theoretical and
  educational implications are discussed."
