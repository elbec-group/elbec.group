abstract: "The main objective of this study was to perform the transcultural
  adaptation of the Multilingual Assessment Instrument for Narratives (MAIN)
  into Chilean Spanish, a narrative assessment tool available in several
  languages. The process consisted of six stages: direct translation, synthesis,
  back translation, revision and preliminary version, piloting, final report,
  and presentation to the expert committee. The adaptation paid special
  attention to lexical, grammatical, and cultural aspects to ensure the
  instrument's understanding and familiarity in the daily context of Chilean
  children, without compromising the original structure and format of the test.
  According to previous studies in other languages, the piloting results showed
  an increase in performance in the narrative production categories with the age
  of children from 4 to 7 years 11 months. Regarding comprehension, an
  improvement was observed with age, reaching a peak around 6 years old. These
  findings are consistent with previous research conducted with the MAIN. The
  availability of a common tool adapted to different languages facilitates
  comparison and data exchange between professionals and researchers from
  various linguistic and cultural contexts. This work also encourages the
  adaptation of the MAIN to other languages spoken in Latin America, opening the
  possibility of evaluating linguistic combinations that are not usually
  considered at present."
