abstract: WhatsApp is a powerful tool for L2 learning because of its capacity to
  promote interaction between teacher and student, as well as among students.
  Its use has also been shown to support ubiquitous learning. In an attempt to
  extend language learning beyond the classroom, this study reports on the use
  of instant messaging through WhatsApp by a group of EFL learners (n = 23) who
  were regularly sent optional language-learning tasks by their teacher during
  an intensive summer course. By the end of a five-week-period, 764 messages had
  been produced, which are explored through a qualitative analysis in the
  present study, with particular attention to changes of participation as a
  result of time. Most of the messages in the WhatsApp group were produced by
  the students in the context of the teacher-initiated tasks and through them
  students had the chance to practice the language as well as engage in real
  communication, even though student participation tended to decrease over time.
  The WhatsApp group was also used for informal communication among the students
  and with the teacher (a total of 289 off-task messages) which, in contrast to
  on-task messages, grew over time. The nature of the interactions also tended
  to be more spontaneous and symmetrical, at times with more of a presence of
  textese. Negotiation of form and content was scarce, but both on-task and
  off-task messages turned out to be equally productive in engaging students to
  use English beyond the walls of the classroom.
