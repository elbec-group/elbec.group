abstract: "The Spanish GRERLI-ES2 corpus compiles texts produced by non-native
  speakers of Spanish. Participants were distributed in three groups according
  to their educational level and age: 4th grade (9 years old), 1st year
  junior-high (12 years old) and university students (over 20 years old).
  Participants were also distributed in three groups according to their L1
  –Arabic, Chinese and Korean– and into different levels of proficiency in
  Spanish –beginner-intermediate (A2, B1), and advanced (B2, C1). The level of
  proficiency was established following the Common European Framework of
  Reference for Languages (CEFR, Council of Europe, 2001). Participants were
  recruited in Madrid, Barcelona and Murcia, and they must have resided in Spain
  for at least four years to ensure minimum abilities for producing the texts.
  Levels of proficiency of each participant are detailed in Table 1. Age means
  and range in the corpus are the following: grade-school children, mean age:
  10;2 (range: 8;2 – 12); junior-high students, mean age: 13;9 (range: 11;1 –
  15;8); university adults, mean age: 20;8 (range: 20 – 43;6)."
