abstract: Effective literacy skills are essential to actively participate in
  today’s society. However, little research has been conducted that examined the
  impact of contextual variables on literacy development. The present paper
  addressed whether and how the socioeconomic status of the school (S-SES)
  children attend affects their literacy achievements. Eight-hundred and
  seventy-eight 2nd and 4th grade children participated in the study. Data were
  collected in low-SES (vulnerable) and in mid-high-SES (non-vulnerable)
  schools. Children completed a large battery of language, cognitive, and
  literacy tasks in Catalan, a language spoken in a region in Spain where
  virtually all children are at least bilingual (they also speak Spanish) and it
  is the main language of instruction. Results showed that children in
  vulnerable schools were outperformed by children in non-vulnerable schools
  across all literacy competencies, but particularly affected higher order
  skills; that is, text quality and reading comprehension. Differences with
  their non-vulnerable peers remained, even after controlling for context-level
  covariates, including familial SES. However, S-SES ceased to exert significant
  influence once children’s cognitive and, especially, linguistic skills were
  considered. The study adds to previous research claiming that school SES has
  an effect on students’ literacy skills, above and beyond children’s home SES.
  However, our findings also suggest that literacy performance is ultimately
  mostly dependent on educationally actionable, subject-level skills.
  Educational implications are discussed.
