abstract: This special issue explores the acquisition of motion events in second
  language (L2) learning, aiming to expand research into less-explored areas.
  Building on foundational studies in the field, the collection presents
  innovative approaches through new methodologies, diverse theoretical
  perspectives, and investigations of underrepresented languages. A key focus is
  on linguistic diversity, with ten different languages represented as either L1
  or L2. The contributions examine cross-linguistic influence, developmental
  patterns, and conceptual factors affecting motion event encoding in L2
  learners. Additionally, the issue highlights the relationship between motion
  and other cognitive domains, as well as pedagogical strategies for teaching
  motion-related patterns. By addressing these topics, this special issue
  advances the understanding of L2 motion event acquisition and opens new
  pathways for future research.
