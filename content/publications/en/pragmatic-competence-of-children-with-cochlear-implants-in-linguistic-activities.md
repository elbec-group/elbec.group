abstract: "The objective of the study was to analyze the pragmatic competence of
  children with cochlear implants (CIs). The researchers explored whether
  children with CIs participated in communicative exchanges in a similar way to
  children with typical hearing (TH), as well as how the participation of
  children with CIs was regulated by the activity they performed. The sample
  consisted of 31 children with CIs (prelingually deaf, with a hearing age equal
  to or greater than 2 years) and 31 children with TH. The researchers used two
  activities to carry out the study: conversation and picture naming. The
  results showed that the children with CIs participated in longer communicative
  exchanges than their peers with TH and had greater difficulty providing
  adequate responses to their interlocutor. The type of linguistic activity and
  their hearing age influenced the responses of the children with CIs."
