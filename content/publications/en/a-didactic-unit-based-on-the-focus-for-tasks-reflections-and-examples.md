abstract: "This article presents an experience of the implementation of a
  pedagogic unit based on the task-based approach. A brief theoretical review of
  the basis of task-based approach is made in order to contextualise the
  experience which is carried out with a group of adult learners in a public
  school in the Balearic Islands. The aims of the article are: 1) to describe
  the phases of the didactic unit and the typology of activities included and 2)
  to show the type of interaction that task-based work can generate. In order to
  achieve these objectives, examples of activities from the different phases are
  given and fragments of the conversation generated by the activities are
  analysed. At the end, a summary is given of the benefits that task-based work
  can have for language learning and, in particular, for adult learners."
