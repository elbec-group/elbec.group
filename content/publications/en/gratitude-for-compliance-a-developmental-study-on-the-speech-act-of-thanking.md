abstract: This study investigates the production of the speech act of thanking
  by L2 learners of Greek from three different proficiency levels (beginner,
  intermediate, and advanced) and seeks to examine the effect of proficiency on
  the learners’ competence to express gratitude in symmetrical and asymmetrical
  situations. The quantitative analysis of the results indicates that no
  significant development is achieved with proficiency and that, irrespective of
  their proficiency, learners lag far behind native speakers in regard to
  expressing gratitude adequately and appropriately. It is maintained here that
  no aspect of pragmatic development should be taken for granted and that
  pedagogical intervention is indispensable for the learners’ development of
  pragmatic competence.
