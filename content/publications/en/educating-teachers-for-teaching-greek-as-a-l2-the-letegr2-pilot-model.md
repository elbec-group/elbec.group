abstract: "Research in instructed language learning environments has shown the
  importance of classroom observation and reflection practices for teacher
  education and professional development. Despite the vast amount of research in
  other contexts, education research on teaching Greek as a Second/Foreign
  Language (L2/FL) is limited. The aim of the current paper is, firstly, to
  present the LETEGR2 program as a pilot teacher education model for the skills
  development of future L2 Greek teachers in Greece and abroad. Secondly, to
  explore future teachersâ€™ attitudes and perceptions. The LETEGR2 model was
  designed based on the principles of action research, classroom observation and
  reflective practice. Participants in this pilot education program were: (a)
  students of the Interdepartmental Postgraduate Program in Teaching Greek as a
  L2 of the University of Athens, Greece and (b) student-teachers who were doing
  their teaching placement at a language school in Barcelona, Spain.
  Participants carried out a series of classroom observations and engaged in
  reflective practices. Their perceptions were collected at the beginning, in
  the middle and at the end of the program through questionnaires, interviews
  and focus groups. Data were analyzed within the theoretical framework of the
  Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Results demonstrated that the LETEGR2
  teacher education model was very positively evaluated, with participants
  highlighting the key role of classroom observation and reflective practices in
  their teacher education and professional development."
