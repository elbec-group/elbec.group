abstract: The adaptation of the Multilingual Assessment Instrument for
  Narratives (LITMUS- MAIN; Gagarina, et al., 2019) to Catalan contributes to
  advancing our knowledge of the development of childrenâ€™s narrative skills in a
  diversity of languages using the same protocol, making it possible to evaluate
  narratives also in Catalan-speakers. The adaptation of MAIN will be very
  useful in Catalonia, because it is a region where two official languages
  (Catalan and Spanish) coexist, Catalan being the language of schooling, so
  that most of the population is bilingual. However, currently there is no
  instrument for assessing narrative skills that allows for parallel assessment
  of Catalan in bilingual children. For these reasons, this adaptation will be
  of great value to promote the study of narratives in the bilingual population
  considering Catalan within the possible language combinations. The present
  paper describes the process of adapting MAIN to Catalan and reports results
  from the first pilot study using the Catalan MAIN.
