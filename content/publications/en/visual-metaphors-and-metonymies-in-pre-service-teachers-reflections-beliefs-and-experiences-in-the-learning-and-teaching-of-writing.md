abstract: This study focuses on visual metaphors and metonymies in
  a [Catalan](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/catalan
  "Learn more about Catalan from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic
  Pages") teacher education context and analyses how 143 pre-service teachers
  use them when reflecting on the learning and teaching of writing in a blog
  post. The results of a thematic analysis show that pre-service teachers use
  visual metonymies and metaphors to help them think metacognitively about
  their [learning
  experiences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/learning-experience
  "Learn more about learning experiences from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic
  Pages") and become aware of their own beliefs. Visual metonymies are more
  frequent and are used as decorative illustrations in relation to the
  reflective text. In contrast, visual metaphors are less frequent but allow for
  deeper conceptualisation of pre-service teachers' beliefs.
