  The present study explores the impact of Study Abroad (SA) on written skills,
  beliefs

  and attitudes in Greek as a foreign language of 41 learners of various proficiency levels who

  were attending a 6-week summer course in Greece. Data collection took place at the start

  and at the end of the course. Participants were asked to produce a written composition

  (opinion essay), the topic of which was specially designed to elicit their reflection on

  their learning experience with Greek in Greece and at home. Data were analyzed both

  quantitatively and qualitatively. Participants’ written development was measured in terms

  of Complexity, Accuracy, Fluency, (CAF), while their reflection was examined through a

  qualitative, thematic analysis of their written productions. Results showed that SA led to

  an improvement in written lexical complexity and fluency. It also helped participants to

  gain awareness on the role of the learning environment in enriching their experiences and

  broadening their knowledge about the target language.
