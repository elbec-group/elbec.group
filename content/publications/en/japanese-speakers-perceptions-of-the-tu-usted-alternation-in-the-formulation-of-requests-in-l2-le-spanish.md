abstract: The goal of this study is to assess the perceptions of Japanese
  speakers about the alternation tú/usted in Spanish L2/FL requests. In Spanish,
  this choice changes the formality, while in Japanese both lexical variations
  and verbal inflection regulate the degree of politeness. Also, honorific
  speech is more common in Japanese than usted in Peninsular Spanish. If based
  on this comparison, Japanese learners might find it difficult to acquire
  adequate politeness marking in Peninsular Spanish. To analyze this phenomenon,
  a Spanish MDCT was administered to two experimental groups of learners
  (L1=Japanese; L1=other languages), as well as to a control group of native
  speakers of Spanish. Results show that Japanese speakers perceive tú as a less
  appropriate form of address and favor the use of usted. Nonetheless, Japanese
  speakers approach native-like performance as the level of competence
  increases.
