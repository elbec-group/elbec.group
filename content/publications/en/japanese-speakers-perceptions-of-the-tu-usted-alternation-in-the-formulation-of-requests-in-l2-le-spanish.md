abstract: This paper assesses the perceptions of Japanese speakers of L2/FL
  Spanish on the 'tú'/'usted' alternation in the formulation of requests. This
  choice regulates formality in Spanish, whereas in Japanese it regulates verb
  inflection and certain lexical variations that are used more frequently than
  'usted' in Peninsular Spanish. It is suggested that Japanese learners may
  experience difficulties in acquiring Spanish politeness due to this
  cross-linguistic contrast. To examine this phenomenon, a discourse selection
  task (MDCT) in Spanish was administered to two groups of learners (L1 =
  Japanese; L1 = other languages) and a group of native Spanish speakers. The
  results suggest that Japanese speakers perceive 'tú' as a less appropriate
  address in favour of 'usted'. However, such speakers can achieve native-like
  proficiency as proficiency level increases.
