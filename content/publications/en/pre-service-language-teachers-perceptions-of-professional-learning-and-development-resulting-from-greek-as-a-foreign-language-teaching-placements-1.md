abstract: Language teacher education research has convincingly shown that
  teaching placements can function as an opportunity for pre-service teachers to
  connect the theoretical knowledge acquired at university with actual classroom
  practices. Despite the extensive body of empirical research that has been
  generated in different foreign language education contexts, the Greek context
  still remains under-investigated. The purpose of the current qualitative and
  longitudinal study—framed within Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis
  (IPA)—is to explore how seven pre-service language teachers of Greek as a
  Foreign Language (L2) reflect on their professional learning, development and
  growth as a result of their teaching placement at a language school in
  Barcelona, Spain. Their perceptions were gathered before and after their
  placements through questionnaires and interviews. Results showed that
  participants perceived their placement as crucial for their professional
  learning and development. They regarded reflective practices as having played
  a key role in their growth as teachers and professionals. The study concludes
  by discussing some implications for the design and development of L2 Greek
  teacher education programs.
