abstract: "The article presents reflections on how to correct and provide
  feedback on the written texts of secondary school students, specifically those
  who do not have Catalan as their home language. Different types of correction
  are proposed, and two strategies are recommended: a) first correcting
  discourse aspects and later linguistic aspects, and b) tailoring corrections
  to the characteristics and needs of the students."
