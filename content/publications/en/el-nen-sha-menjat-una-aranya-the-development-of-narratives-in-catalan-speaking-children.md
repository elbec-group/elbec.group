abstract: The production of a well-constructed narrative is the culmination of
  several years of language acquisition and is an important milestone in
  children's development. There is no current description of narrative
  development for Catalan speaking children. This study collected elicited
  narratives in Catalan from 118 children aged 4;0–10;11. Narratives were scored
  for macrostructure and microstructure. Narrative scores improved with age with
  maximum performance for macrostructure by 9 years. Children's ability to use
  micro-structural components of Catalan is variable with some developments
  continuing beyond 9 years. The results are discussed in relation to
  theoretical arguments about universal and specific features of narrative
  development. We conclude by highlighting the usefulness of the new test for
  future language assessment of children acquiring Catalan.
