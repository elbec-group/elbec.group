abstract: "Mobile instant messaging (MIM) applications such as WhatsApp have
  been established as important pedagogical tools for extending foreign language
  (L2) learning and practice beyond the classroom, increasing students’ exposure
  to the L2, promoting interaction, and providing corrective feedback (CF).
  Despite CF being extensively studied in face-to-face classrooms, its
  exploration in MIM contexts is limited. The present study aimed to investigate
  student perceptions about CF provided through MIM in two different timing
  modalities: post-task and during-task. More specifically, the current study
  explored the experience of an intact group of 10 adult L2 intermediate
  learners of Modern Greek in Barcelona, Spain, who received a five-week
  pedagogical intervention through WhatsApp as an extension of their online
  course. Learners participated in a series of communicative activities for
  which they received CF in the two modalities. The WhatsApp chat (1.074
  messages in total) was analyzed to offer a holistic view of the students’
  participation and interaction. Participants’ perceptions of CF, gathered
  through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, indicated a positive
  attitude towards using WhatsApp and a strong appreciation for the CF. Overall,
  the students preferred the during-task feedback, even though they recognized
  that both modalities were useful. The study concludes by discussing the
  pedagogical implications and challenges of CF in MIM for language learning."
