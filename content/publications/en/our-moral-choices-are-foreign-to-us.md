abstract: "Though moral intuitions and choices seem fundamental to our core
  being, there is surprising new evidence that people resolve moral dilemmas
  differently when they consider them in a foreign language (Cipolletti et al.,
  2016; Costa et al., 2014a; Geipel et al., 2015): People are more willing to
  sacrifice 1 person to save 5 when they use a foreign language compared with
  when they use their native tongue. Our findings show that the phenomenon is
  robust across various contexts and that multiple factors affect it, such as
  the severity of the negative consequences associated with saving the larger
  group. This has also allowed us to better describe the phenomenon and
  investigate potential explanations. Together, our results suggest that the
  foreign language effect is most likely attributable to an increase in
  psychological distance and a reduction in emotional response."
