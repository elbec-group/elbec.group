abstract: "Findings around the cognitive resources needed to compose text have
  helped shape current models of writing. Some of these models predict that text
  generation is constrained by two groups of skills: transcription (i.e.,
  spelling and handwriting) and executive functions (EFs). While the
  constraining role of transcription on text generation is robust, the
  relationship between writing and EFs is more scarce. Some studies suggest that
  the impact of EFs on writing development is not only direct, but also
  indirect, through transcription skills. However, few studies have analyzed
  these effects over a sufficiently wide developmental period. In this paper, we
  examined transcription and EF skills in a large sample of beginner (G2),
  intermediate (G4), and upper-intermediate (G8) children (N = 1337). Each
  participant produced a narrative and an opinion essay. In addition, we
  collected measures of the low-level EFs of inhibition and updating of working
  memory, as well as measures of handwriting fluency and spelling accuracy.
  Results showed that EFs impacted text generation directly and indirectly via
  transcription skills, especially via handwriting. Transcription skills
  constrained text generation across grade levels and its weight was similar
  from the youngest through to the oldest age group. We conclude that EFs
  support low-level writing skills, as well as key processes involved in
  children’s text composing (i.e., knowledge-telling processes). Relevant
  educational implications are discussed."
