abstract: "Corrective feedback is essential in foreign language (L2) teaching
  and has been the subject of numerous studies. However, the factor of timing
  (i.e., when errors are addressed during the instructional process) has been
  little explored in both face-to-face and online contexts and will be the focus
  of this study, which takes place in the context of instant messaging (IM). The
  IM environment is particularly interesting as a tool for corrective feedback,
  as it allows attention to be given to language during the process of
  semi-spontaneous communication. The present study aims to investigate
  students' perceptions of the provision of corrective feedback via WhatsApp in
  two timing modalities: feedback provided during the task and after the task.
  More specifically, it explores the experience of an intact group of 10 adult
  learners of Modern Greek as an L2 in Barcelona (B1 level) who received a
  four-week instructional intervention via WhatsApp as an extension of their
  online course. The students participated in a series of communicative
  activities outside of class hours, for which they received corrective feedback
  in two modalities. Their perceptions of both were collected through
  questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The results showed a preference
  for feedback during the task and for a combination of both modalities. The
  study concludes by highlighting the pedagogical implications of corrective
  feedback in IM contexts."
