abstract: Teaching competencies, professional development, and reflective
  practice are basic issues faced by teachers of foreign languages. To work on
  these aspects, reference documents have been prepared that propose a way of
  categorising teacher competencies, and that offer evaluation frameworks. The
  objective of this study is to determine the relationships between teaching
  competencies based on the type of contract a teacher is on, and its effect on
  their professional development. A questionnaire on the competencies of
  teachers of Spanish as a foreign language was designed based on the document
  Competencias Clave del Profesorado del Instituto Cervantes. The factorial
  analysis applied to the data obtained from a group of teachers (N = 67) from
  the Instituto Cervantes, identified several subcompetencies among the original
  competencies. The results allow us to characterise the competency development
  of teachers and to explore the relationships established between different
  competencies. The comparisons made show different behaviours between permanent
  teachers and those on an hourly-based contract, regarding their involvement in
  professional development and their participation in teacher improvement
  activities. While permanent teachers refer to a high level of active
  participation in the centre, among hourly-based contract teachers this
  participation presents greater variability and determines the development of
  other competencies.
