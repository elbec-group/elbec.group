abstract: "Adjectives, like nouns and verbs, are one of the three major classes
  of lexical words. But, unlike nouns and verbs, they emerge late in
  acquisition. In Catalan, as in many other languages, their use is closely
  linked to the literate lexicon learned at school-age. Thus, the use of
  adjectives can be a good indicator of later language development. The goal of
  this study is twofold: to characterize the use of adjectives from age 9 to
  adulthood and to examine the effect of discourse genre (expository and
  narrative) and mode of production (spoken and written) on frequency of use and
  word-internal morphological structure. The study takes a corpus-based approach
  and uses the GRERLI-CAT1 corpus, which contains 316 expository and narrative
  spoken and written texts produced by 79 Spanish/Catalan bilinguals whose home
  language is Catalan, at four age and schooling levels: primary school (9- to
  10-year-olds), secondary school (12- to 13-year-olds), sixth form (16- to
  18-year-olds) and university (adults). Results show that the use of adjectives
  expands through school-age and especially from sixth form onwards, presenting
  an increasing pattern. An effect of genre and mode of production on the target
  features was also detected. Expository texts contain significantly more
  adjectives per text and clause and lower-frequency adjectives than narrative
  texts. Written texts contain significantly more adjectives, and
  lower-frequency and longer adjectives, than spoken texts. Age interacts with
  mode of production in the use and morphological complexity of adjectives. The
  four text types analysed (spoken expository, written expository, spoken
  narrative and written narrative) present a complexity cline, from written
  expository texts to spoken narratives through spoken expository texts and
  written narratives."
