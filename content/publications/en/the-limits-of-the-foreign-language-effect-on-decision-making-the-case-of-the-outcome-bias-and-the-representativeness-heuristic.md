abstract: Language context (native vs. foreign) affects people’s choices and
  preferences in a wide variety of situations. However, emotional reactions are
  a key component driving people’s choices in those situations. In six studies,
  we test whether foreign language context modifies biases and the use of
  heuristics not directly caused by emotional reactions. We fail to find
  evidence that foreign language context modifies the extent to which people
  suffer from outcome bias (Experiment 1a & 1b) and the use of the
  representativeness heuristic (Experiment 2a & 2b). Furthermore, foreign
  language context does not modulate decision-making in those scenarios even
  when emotion is brought into the context (Experiment 1c & 2c). Foreign
  language context shapes decision-making, but the scope of its effects might be
  limited to decision-making tendencies in which emotion plays a causal role.
