abstract: Mastering analytical writing involves the proficient use of varied
  later-acquired grammatical, lexical and discourse forms and functions.
  Developmental studies have identified specific linguistic features as
  diagnostic of increasing proficiency. This study examines how these features
  change throughout educational levels and before and after the implementation
  of a set of classroom activities aimed at homogenizing participants’
  pedagogical input while raising their awareness of analytical texts’ main
  functions. Two hundred and twelve Spanish speakers from primary, secondary and
  university levels participate in the study, each producing two analytical
  texts. The corpus consists of 424 texts produced on the same topic. Results
  indicate that not all the features pertaining to the same domain show
  identical changes across educational levels or are identically sensitive to
  pedagogical work. Productivity measures increase with educational level and
  after pedagogical work, except for university students. Most lexical,
  syntactic and discourse-level measures improve with educational level, though
  their sensitivity to pedagogical work is not straightforward. Findings suggest
  the need to evaluate writing quality at a high level of granularity.
