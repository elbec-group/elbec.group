abstract: "In the current study we investigated the relationship between ethnic
  prejudice and resilience and the perception of inclusion of immigrant students
  among primary and middle school teachers in two different countries (Italy and
  Spain). Participants were 315 teachers: 75 Catalan women, 25 Catalan men, 202
  Italian women, and 13 Italian men. Participants completed the Classical and
  Modern Racial Prejudice Scale, the Resilience Process Questionnaire, and an ad
  hoc questionnaire evaluating teachers’ perceptions about immigrant students
  and their inclusive education process. The results showed two different
  models: The first one, referring to Italian teachers, suggested that the
  resilience component “return to homeostasis” helps teachers in the creation of
  positive perceptions and evaluations toward immigrant pupils and their
  inclusion process. The second model, referring to Catalan teachers, suggested
  that ethnic prejudice hinders the creation of positive attitudes and
  evaluations, but the resilience component “reintegration after loss” helps
  teachers in the creation of positive attitudes. Psychoeducational and
  practical implications are discussed."
