abstract: Written corrective feedback (WCF) aims to enhance students' writing
  skills by providing feedback on their texts, which can be done using a variety
  of strategies. This entry reviews different typologies of WCF focusing on the
  characterization of feedback types (direct, indirect, and metalinguistic).
  Updated classifications are provided to address terminological inconsistencies
  and a more detailed categorization. The importance of understanding WCF
  typologies for both teachers and researchers is emphasized, and insights
  offered into how feedback strategies are defined and may be implemented in the
  classroom.
