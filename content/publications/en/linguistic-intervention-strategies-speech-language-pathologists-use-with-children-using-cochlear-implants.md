abstract: "The aim of this study was to explore the strategies that
  speech-language pathologists (SLPs) use during their linguistic interventions
  on children with cochlear implants (CIs). The sample comprised 7 SLPs in
  interactions with 62 children, 31 with CIs and 31 with typical hearing (TH),
  from 5 to 7 years of age. Two linguistic activities were used: conversation
  and naming. With children with CIs, the SLPs used 3.8 times more adaptation
  strategies and 5 times more educational strategies in the conversation
  activity, and 1.4 times more educational strategies in the naming activity
  than with children with TH. Communication strategies were significantly more
  frequent in the conversation activity than in the naming activity while
  educational strategies were more frequent in the naming activity than in the
  conversation activity. The auditory age of children with CIs also influenced
  the use of these two types of strategies, increasing the use of communication
  strategies by 0.6% and decreasing the use of educational strategies by 1.2%
  for each month of increase in the auditory age. In order to foster linguistic
  development, the SLPs used a wide variety of strategies with the children with
  CIs, adjusting them to the activity and the auditory age."
