abstract: This article reports findings from an investigation into migrant and
  non-migrant origin pre-service teachers’ beliefs about multilingualism and the
  relationship between their linguistic trajectories as students and how they
  perceive themselves as future teachers. We analize the beliefs of around
  seventy pre-service teachers taking part in a university course, collected
  through an individual reflection tool based on a SWOT analysis (Strengths,
  Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) and a group discussion in which students
  had to discuss their ideas and create a collective document. In this article
  we focus on the discourse of four pre-service teachers, two of whom had
  migration backgrounds and two of whom who did not. Findings suggest that
  pre-service teachers’ life and learning experiences contribute to different
  emotions and feeling about language and teaching in a multilingual setting.
  They also influence the perception the pre-service teachers have of themselves
  as future teachers. Pre-service teachers regard the preparation received at
  the university negatively and express insecurities. Findings illustrate that
  migrant origin pre-service teachers feel more prepared in the sense they
  believe that their migration experience can help to understand newcoming
  students and be empathic with them.
