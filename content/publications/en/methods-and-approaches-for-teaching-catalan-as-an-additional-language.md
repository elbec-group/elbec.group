abstract: Sometimes, methodological changes may seem to follow trends, but in
  reality, they result from addressing, on the one hand, societyâ€™s needs in a
  specific cultural context for language learning and, on the other, the desire
  to implement research findings and reach a consensus on proposals from
  different periods. This evolution involves the adaptation, recovery, or
  inclusion of aspects from approaches or methods of earlier periods into
  current methods, with the aim of offering the most effective strategies to
  facilitate language learning. With this purpose, the authors of this volume
  review the different methods and approaches for teaching additional languages
  to adults. They highlight their influence and relevance and emphasize how the
  legacy of each has endured in the teaching of Catalan.
