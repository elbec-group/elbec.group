abstract: SRSD interventions on writing have shown to be effective across a
  myriad of contexts and populations. Less is known, however, about their
  effectiveness for improving the writing skills of disadvantaged children,
  relative to their efficacy with other types of students. This is important,
  because low-SES children have been found to often display poor levels of
  written composition, which is key to preventing school failure. This study
  thus aimed to test the efficacy of an SRSD program for opinion essay writing
  in low- and mid-high SES classrooms. Participants were 645 children, attending
  2nd and 4th grade classrooms, who were quasi-randomly assigned to the
  experimental (SRSD) or to the control condition. Children were assessed at
  pre- and post-test, where measures of text productivity, structural elements,
  and text quality were obtained. In addition, children’s text spelling accuracy
  and reading comprehension skills were evaluated to test for developmental
  cascading effects. Children in the SRSD condition outscored the control group
  in all outcomes, regardless of their SES background. Moreover, some children
  in the SRSD group improved reading comprehension, but this added benefit was
  only observed in the mid-high-SES children. No group made gains on spelling
  accuracy at posttest. We discuss the theoretical and educational implications
  of our findings.
