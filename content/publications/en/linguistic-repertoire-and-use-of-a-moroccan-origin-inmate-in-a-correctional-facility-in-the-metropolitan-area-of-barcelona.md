abstract: This paper presents a case study of an internal student of Moroccan
  origin at a prison located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona within the
  framework of the European project KA2
  StrategicPartnershipRiUscire.  The  first  results  of  the  European  project  suggest  the  cultural
  diversity  and  plurilingualism  of  the  prison  context  and  the  need  to  improve  the  intercultural
  competence and linguistic competence of internal students, in order to
  contribute to their social
  and  professional  reintegration.  The  present  study  aims  to  investigate  in  the  linguistic  repertoire
  and  the  linguistic  uses  of  the  young  man.  We  have  also  explored  how  he  values  his  linguistic
  competence  in  different  languages  as  well  as  his  attitudes  towards  languages  that  make  up  his
  linguistic  repertoire.  The  exploratory  research  is  framed  within  a  qualitative  methodology  and
  consists  in  analysing  a  semi-structured  interview  that  the  young  man  gave  in  the  prison
  consideringthe  discourse  analysis  method  taking  into  account  what  the  interviewee  says
  and how.
