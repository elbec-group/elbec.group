abstract: The acquisition of effective reading comprehension for adolescents
  with cochlear implant (CI) in inclusive settings is crucial for ensuring the
  benefit of current traditional reading curricula and instructional practices.
  Executive functions (EF) are recognized as important cognitive processes
  during reading by students with typical hearing (TH). This study compared the
  relationship between EF and reading comprehension in adolescents with TH and
  CI. Three tests sessions were performed on two groups of adolescents between
  12 and 16 years old (36 with CI and 54 with TH). Reading comprehension was
  assessed by a standardized reading battery and EF by computerized tests. The
  results indicated that adolescents with CI perform EF tasks with a similar
  efficiency as the TH group, but the performance of CI group on expository
  texts was lower than in TH students. Reading comprehension of expository texts
  was related to inhibition and shifting in adolescents with CI.
