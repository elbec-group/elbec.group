abstract: The development of analytical writing requires mastery of specialized
  linguistic forms and functions. Students of all educational levels have
  problems with the organization of information and the use of specific formal
  resources. We focus on intra-sentential connectives and discourse markers that
  contribute to text cohesion and guide the logical-semantic relationships
  between units of discourse, as they are considered predictors of writing
  development and indicators of text quality. We analyze the texts produced by
  128 Catalan high school and university students in order to identify the
  difficulties they have in establishing connectivity and defining developmental
  trajectories. The texts were produced after implementing a didactic sequence
  on academic writing. We examine the repertoire of markers (conjunctions,
  parenthetical markers, lexical markers) and the discursive functions they
  perform (propositional, structural, modal). The results show differences
  between the two groups in the use of conjunctions, which are used more
  frequently by high school students, and parenthetical markers, which are more
  commonly used by university students. With regard to discourse functions,
  differences between the groups also appear in modal markers. The structural
  efficacy and coherence of a text are related to proficient use of connectivity
  markers, their function within a text, and the expression of the writer’s
  stance. The use of structural markers is uncommon for both groups, but
  university students are more willing to use them in order to express their
  stance.
