  Collocations have become increasingly important in our understanding of

  foreign language learning. When it comes to setting vocabulary learning

  goals, concerns about how to address collocations still arise today. This

  article explores the distribution of collocations in L1 and L2 Spanish

  production with the ultimate goal of informing the design of graded lexical

  inventories of multi-word combinations. To do so, we explore three defining

  properties of collocations in L1 and L2 production data, and across different

  levels of L2 proficiency: syntactic structure, semantic transparency, and the

  strength of association. Results indicate that there is an increase of

  collocational density and diversity, but that isolated features of collocations

  fail to predict L2 proficiency. Findings suggest the need to evaluate

  collocation use at a high level of granularity.
