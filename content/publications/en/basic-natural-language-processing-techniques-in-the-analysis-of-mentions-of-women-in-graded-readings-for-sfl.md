abstract: Analyses of gender representation in textbooks of Spanish as a Foreign
  Language (sfl) have been limited by manual-count methods. The present study
  adopts a different approach and investigates gender representation in a corpus
  of 47 graded readings for students of L2 Spanish by applying basic Natural
  Language Processing techniques based on the work by Lucy, Demszky, Bromley,
  and Jurafsky (2020). The differences in the space devoted to each gender and
  its evolution over time are examined. Likewise, the explanatory value of the
  gender of the main characters on the distribution of mentions of men and women
  is explored. The results show that women are underrepresented, even in books
  where the main characters are both women and men. This work provides the
  results of the analysis and a set of tools for text analysis that is available
  for the community to apply it to the analysis of other texts or to adapt it to
  analyze different social aspects of language use and to deepen the
  characterization of the teaching materials used in sfl.
