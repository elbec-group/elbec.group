abstract: Writing development is understood to be a multidimensional task,
  heavily constrained by spelling in its early stages. However, most available
  evidence comes from studies with learners of the inconsistent English
  orthography, so our understanding of the nature of early writing could be
  highly biased. We explored writing dimensions in each language by assessing a
  series of text-based features in children’s texts between mid-Grade 1 to
  mid-Grade 2. Results revealed that two constructs, writing conventions and
  productivity, emerged in both languages, but the influence of orthographic
  consistency started to be evident in the later time points. Other constructs
  of text generation seemed to emerge later and were less stable over time. The
  article thus highlights the language-general underpinnings of early
  text-writing development and the impact of orthographic consistency;
  furthermore, it strengthens the view that some writing components develop
  before others. We discuss implications for the assessment of early written
  products.
