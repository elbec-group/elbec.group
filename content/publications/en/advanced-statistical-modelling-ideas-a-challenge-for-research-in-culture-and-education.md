abstract: The availability of computerized statistical packages allows us to
  plug in our data and to expect a set of estimates, which we can communicate in
  our final research report. However, statistical software is not an end; it is
  only the means. Our responsibility as researchers is to develop a set of
  arguments that explain why our final methodological choice is the better one,
  which will yield reliable answers for the study questions within the
  theoretical setting. Journals of all types require authors to deploy
  innovative statistical models when analysing collected data. Yet, the problem
  of advanced modelling strategies still remains  authors disregard key
  assumptions, choose the wrong analytical strategies and are not aware of
  alternative strategies to support or reject their hypotheses. This special
  issue provides readers with a reference framework for some of the most common
  methodological concerns. The articles included in this monographic issue deal
  with relatable scenarios and offer state-of-the-art statistical approaches to
  data treatment. We are confident that this special issue will be extremely
  useful to past and future authors of *Cultura y Educación*, and we hope it
  will increase the quality of the papers published by the journal.
