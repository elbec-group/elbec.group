  This study explores the occurrence of developmental patterns in the

  use of metaphors by native and non-native speakers of Spanish in discourse.

  Underlying this analysis is the assumption that intentionally using figurative

  language – and thus engaging a cross-domain mapping from a source to a target

  domain – is a communicative choice on the part of the speaker-writer. Taking

  into account the universality, and creativity of metaphor, this study aims to determine

  the effect of age, L2 proficiency level, discourse genre and modality of production

  in the production of deliberate metaphorical expressions by non-native

  vs. native Spanish speakers. For this purpose, we analyze the oral and written

  expository and narrative texts produced by 30 native and 47 non-native speakers

  (L1= Arabic, Chinese) of Spanish of three different age groups (grade-school,

  junior-high, and university students). The results of the study provide a developmental

  framework of the production of deliberate metaphor in discourse. Even

  though the results of the study do not show a significant proficiency development

  framework for the production of metaphor in discourse, we offer valuable

  insights into how creativity and transfer have an impact on the use of metaphors

  in non-native discourse.
