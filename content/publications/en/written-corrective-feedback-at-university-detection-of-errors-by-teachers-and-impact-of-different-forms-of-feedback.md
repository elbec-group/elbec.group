abstract: This study explores the written corrective feedback provided by two
  university teachers in the academic texts written by their students.
  Specifically, it focuses on the relationship established between the
  linguistic and discursive errors identified by the teachers, the forms of
  feedback provided (direct, indirect, metalinguistic and metadiscursive) and
  the impact of feedback on a second version of the texts revised by the
  students. A total of 142 texts (two versions of 71 texts) submitted by two
  groups of students taking primary education degrees at two Spanish
  universities (71 students) were analyzed. These were coded according to the
  errors detected, the form of feedback provided, and the way in which they
  incorporated this feedback into a second version. The results show that the
  errors detected in the highest numbers by the teachers were discursive,
  followed by morpho-syntactic and spelling mistakes. The most common feedback
  was indirect, followed by metalinguistic, although the two teachers were found
  to take distinct approaches. Regarding its incorporation, the students
  assimilated a high percentage (80%) of the feedback provided.
