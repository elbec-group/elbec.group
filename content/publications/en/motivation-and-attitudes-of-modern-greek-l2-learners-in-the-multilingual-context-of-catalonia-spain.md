abstract: This study examines the motivations and attitudes of multilingual
  learners in Catalonia, Spain, towards learning Modern Greek as a Foreign
  Language. Understanding why students choose to study Languages Other Than
  English (LOTEs) in various contexts deepens insights into second language (L2)
  learning motivations. The participants (n=20) were adult multilingual learners
  at a language school in Barcelona, Spain, with Catalan and Spanish as their
  first languages. Narrative data from semi-structured interviews were analyzed
  using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), with theoretical
  grounding in Positive Psychology, specifically Seligman’s PERMA model, and
  Dörnyei’s L2 Motivational Self System (L2MSS). The findings revealed that the
  L2 learning experience, characterized by positive emotions, engagement,
  relationships, meaning, and accomplishment, was a key motivational factor.
  Participants also perceived a connection between Modern Greek and their native
  Catalan, a minority language in both the European and Spanish contexts. Some
  learners also embodied an anti-ought-to-self, as their motivation was
  self-determined and ran counter to external societal pressures that emphasize
  the utilitarian value of language learning.
