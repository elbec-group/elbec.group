abstract: "This article presents a proposal for the classification of causal
  constructions and causal connectivity between clauses and larger discourse
  segments. This classification can be used in future corpus-based studies. To
  this end, we unify two perspectives and analytical classifications: (a) the
  distinction, in the Hispanic tradition, between statement-level and
  utterance-level causals, and (b) the distinction, within the theoretical
  framework of relational coherence, between semantic and pragmatic causals (van
  Dijk, 1979; Sanders, 1997), and, in particular, between content causals,
  speech-act causals, and epistemic causals (Sweetser, 1990). After addressing
  their linguistic characterization, we consider two types of constructions:
  those with verbs of speech and thought in the non-causal segment, and
  borderline cases that can pragmatically be classified as speech-act and
  epistemic causals. On the one hand, we examine causal connectors, conceiving
  them as propositional markers (Cuenca, Marín, Romano & Porto, 2011); on the
  other hand, we analyze causal structures involving more than two related
  elements. Finally, we highlight the need to identify non-canonical uses of
  causal structures and to further explore the expression of causality beyond
  two-member constructions."
