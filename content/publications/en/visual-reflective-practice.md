abstract: Visual reflective practice (VRP) explores the role that images play in
  language education. Studies on students' language‚Äêlearning processes
  demonstrate how images can facilitate metalinguistic and metacognitive
  reflection across various age groups. And studies on reflective practice in
  language teacher education show how images reveal teacher beliefs and
  identities, contributing to a deeper understanding of language teaching and
  learning dynamics. The pedagogical implications of VRP suggest that visual
  methods can offer innovative approaches to language teaching and learning,
  foster digital literacy skills, and enrich conceptual understanding in
  language teacher education.
