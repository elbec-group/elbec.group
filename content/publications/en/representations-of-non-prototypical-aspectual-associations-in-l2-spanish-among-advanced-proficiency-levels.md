abstract: "Numerous studies on the acquisition of tense-aspect systems in second
  languages (L2) have tested the validity of the Aspectual Hypothesis (AH) in
  learning the perfective/imperfective opposition in Spanish. Results from
  recent studies identify some conditions that complement the predictions of the
  AH: cross-linguistic influence, frequency differences in input, and aspectual
  coercion. The production of perfective and imperfective verb forms in L2
  Spanish shows a predominance of prototypical combinations of lexical and
  grammatical aspect: atelic verbs with imperfective morphemes and telic verbs
  with perfective morphemes. Although the handling of non-prototypical aspectual
  associations stabilizes at advanced levels of L2, some experimental studies
  show that certain combinations of aspectual coercion still present
  difficulties. This work analyzes what interpretations advanced L2 Spanish
  learners have regarding different aspectual coercion scenarios and what effect
  the frequency of these verbal forms has on the acquisition of non-prototypical
  aspectual associations. The study includes 68 advanced-level Spanish learners
  (L1 Russian) and 25 native speakers, who completed a preference judgment task.
  The stimuli present contexts favoring prototypical and non-prototypical
  associations between stative verbs, activities, accomplishments, achievements,
  and imperfect and preterite forms. The results indicate that some preferences
  for non-prototypical combinations emerge in L2 before others; the semantic
  feature of duration, rather than telicity, seems to guide the preference
  order, indicating a possible L1 effect. A slight lexical frequency effect is
  also observed, especially with stative verbs."
